<h3>Viewing Branches</h3>
Use *git branch* to view your existing branches. The default branch in every git repo is master, though you can configure this.
```cosole
git branch
```

<h3>Creating Branches</h3>
Use git branch <branch-name> to make a new branch based upon the current HEAD.
This just creates the branch.  It does not switch you to that branch (the HEAD stays the same).
```cosloe
git branch <branch-name>
```
