<h3>Atomic Commits</h3>
When possible, a commit should encompass a single feature, change, or fix.  In other words, try to keep each commit focused on a single thing.
This makes it much easier to undo or rollback changes later on.  It also makes your code or project easier to review.

<h3>Writing Commit Messages</h3>

* Present or past tense? From the Git docs: we should use present tense but we can be different.

<h3>Configuring Git's Default Editor</h3>

* Vim is the default editor of Git. for use it we should know some stuff like press *I* for insert mode *Esc* to exit from insert mode and *:wq* to save and exit from it.
* [This](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Appendix-C%3A-Git-Commands-Setup-and-Config) link will help us to set another editor as default editor.
* It is important because some times we want to write long message and can't do it in terminal.
