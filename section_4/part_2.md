**git log**
	
* git log is a important thing and that will show us the all history of git repo.
* it use for different thing like revisit a commit or undo a commit or ... but it has to many information and like a little ugly.
* we can order the log history by time or user or ....
* **Commit Formatting:** is a way to see short or better log.
* for example we can use --oneline flag to see each commit in one line or --abbrev-commit to see shorter commit hash.
* for more check [this](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log) link.
