<h3>Comparisons With Git Diff</h3>

We can use the git diff command to view changes between commits, branches, files, our working directory, and more!
We often use git diff alongside commands like git status and git log, to get a better picture of a repository and how it has changed over time.

**git diff**
Without additional options, git diff lists all the changes in our working directory that are *NOT staged* for the next commit.

```console
git diff
```
