<h3>Basic Git command :</h3>

1.  **git status**
	* git status gives information on the current status of a git repository and its contents.

2.  **git init**
	* Use git init to create a new git repository. Before we can do anything git-related, we must initialize a repo first!
	* This is something you do once per project.  Initialize the repo in the top-level folder containing your project.
	*  Note: *Git Tracks A Directory and All Nested Subdirectories.*
	* 	 WARNING: *DO NOT INIT A REPO INSIDE OF A REPO!*
	*	> To delete a repo, locate the associated *.git* directory and delete it.
