### Git History :

* `Linus Torvalds` was the creator and the main developer behind Linux and Git.

* In 2005, while working on Linux, he become frustrated with the available version control systems. The existing were slow, closed-source, and usually paid. On *April 3rd 2005* he got to work on his own VCS which would become Git. In a matter of days he had most basic functionality done.

* Torvalds referred to Git as "the stupid content tracker" while he was working on it.
* The official Git source code explain a couple different meaning for the name :

	* a random three-letter combination that is pronounceable and not actually used by any common UNIX command.

	* stupid. contemptible and despicable. simple.

	* "global information tracker" : it work.

	* "goddamn idiotic truckload of shit" : it breaks.

	* "unpleasant person" on British English.
