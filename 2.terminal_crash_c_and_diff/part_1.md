3. GUI Clients:

	  Pros                                     | Cons                           
	------------------------------ | ----------------------------
  	Way lower barrier-of-entry for beginners compared to the command-line. | At times, there is lots of "magic" involved.  The inner-workings of Git are obfuscated and hidden away with GUI's.
  	Friendlier to use.  Can be a much better experience (when it works) | Often leads to dependance on a particular piece of software.
  	Some people prefer the visual experience, even those who can use the command-line | When things go seriously wrong, it can be very challenging to fix without the command-line

4. The Command Line

	|  Pros   | Cons |
	|------- | -------- |
  	| Git is a command-line tool.  All the documentation and resources online will refer to the command-line | Not beginner-friendly.  At All. Can be difficult to learn and remember the commands at first.
  	The command-line can be way faster once you get comfortable with it! |  Even for some practiced users, the command-line interface is just not a good experience.  It's really a matter of preference.
	  Some of the more advanced Git features are only available on the command-line |   
	  The commands are always the same, no matter what machine you are on! |
