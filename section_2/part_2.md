**Configuring Git**
You do not need to register for an account or anything, but you will need to provide:
-  Your name
-  Your email

1. To configure the name that Git will associate with your work, run this command:
	```cosole
	git config --global user.name "Name"
	```

2. Do the same thing for your email using the following command:
	```cosole
	git config --global user.email 	EmailName@blah.com
	```

3. To see the registered name and email, we use the following commands:
	```cosole
	git config user.name
	git config user.email
	```
